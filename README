    Bjoern B. Brandenburg and James H. Anderson
    The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill


This is the source distribution of Feather-Trace. 
It is intended to be incorporated into an existing 
application / operating system / embedded system by providing "glue code". 

A simple example is included in test/example.c. Execute make to build it.

Tested with gcc 4.1.2. 

Please see http://www.cs.unc.edu/~bbb/feathertrace/ for an example on how 
to use the toolkit.
