Dynamic Library Support
=======================

Dynamic library support currently requires a GNU libc because of the use of
dl_iterate_phdr(). 

If you want to refer to event handlers in the main executable from a library
you may have to use the -rdynamic option with gcc to force the linker to place
the symbol in the dynamic symbol table.


Tracing with LD_PRELOAD
=======================

You can trace the use of certain library functions by pre-loading a
Feather-Trace enabled library. Currently, only support for pthread_mutex_t
based synchronization is implemented. 

An application /bin/foo can be traced like this (assuming that you are in the
Feather Trace directory):

$ LD_PRELOAD="./libpthread_preload.so ./libft_saved.so" /bin/foo

The script mutex_trace will automate this process as long as the Feather Trace
directory is part of the library search path. Example:

$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/feathertrace:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
$ mutex_trace /bin/foo
